# FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz is a classic programming interview challenge. The program will display numbers in the range of 0 to 100. If the user has entered the number 3 as their Fizz value and the number 5 as their Buzz value, multiples of 3 and 5 will be replaced with the words "Fizz" and "Buzz" accordingly. The numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 will be replaced with "FizzBuzz".
